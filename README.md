# SOLANA CINEMA
As I dabble with rust and react, I embarked on a simple starter project that allows you to insert gifs on the solana blockchain. 

Currently live HERE: https://main.d2lhelod0wnz17.amplifyapp.com/

### Instructions
Connect your phantom wallet to the app and view/add gifs.
Currently this app is limited to only Solana wallets

This is also my first time deploying a nextjs project onto AWS so lets see where we can go from here
